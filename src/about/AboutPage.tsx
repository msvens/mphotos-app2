                    Mellowtech Photos is my personal photoblog. It also serves as the homepage for mellowtech
                    (<Link href={"#mellowtech"}>see below</Link>)
                    There are a lot of photo blogs out there - instagram, flickr, photobucket, etc. None, however
                    did what I exactly wanted. Namely to
                    <ul>
                        <li>Take full advantage of exif information stored typically in your jpegs</li>
                        <li>All editing (including meta information) done in lightroom</li>
                        <li>Offer a tight integration with Google Drive</li>

                    mellowtech came into existence back in 2002 when Martin Svensson and Rickard CÃ¶ster
                    (then 2 phd studends) decided to start a software company. A great deal of time was spent on finding
                    a good name, in the end we ended up with mellow - we thought it captured what we were about.
                    A lot of relaxing and at the same time producing solid (actually another name we had in mind)
                    and mature code. As with many other grand ideas running a company while doing your phd did not
                    turn out to be the best of ideas, especially since we mostly wanted to create cool stuff.
                    <p>
                        In the end one the company died but the idea of mellowtech prevailed. It has been a playground
                        for fiddling with things such as, disc based search and sort, key-value stores, social graphs,
                        oauth & openid and blog sofware. Some of it has lived for a very long time while other stuff
                        have been developed recently.
