                    Mellowtech Core is a set of components that we use for doing disc and byte based manipulation of Objects.
                    It is typically useful for any scenario that involves storing and sorting large amounts
                    of Objects (in the millions) on disc. Mellowtech allows for consistent and fast
                    disc based object retrieval. The library is being actively developed.

                    Diary writing is something
                    that many people engage in and is a very important tool to keep track of the important things. In this project
                    we were looking at ways of enhancing the diary writing process by adding contextual and temporal information
                    into the diary itself. By tapping in to things a person is doing on the phone together with bodily sensor data
                    we allowed people to reflect on what was happening at certain points in time. The Diary itself was developed
                    using
                    C# on a tablet and Windows Mobile. The project was later commercialized into a product called Affective Health.

                    that time the only true smart phone OS - Symbian and used bluetooth to automatically exchange recommendations
                    between people that were close to each other. The recommender system itself was a hybrid
                    centralized/decentralized
                    one allowing it to function while not being connected.

                    that we created Kalas back in 2000. I developed the back end and client parts of Kalas as part of my PhD
                    thesis work. In this project we also did extensive user studies to find out how and what triggers people to
                    use recommender systems or more generally engage in social navigation. Kalas is the Swedish word for party.
